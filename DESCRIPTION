Description: Bayesian approaches for analyzing multivariate data in ecology. Estimation is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods via Three. JAGS types of models may be fitted: 1) With explanatory variables only, boral fits independent column Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to each column of the response matrix; 2) With latent variables only, boral fits a purely latent variable model for model-based unconstrained ordination; 3) With explanatory and latent variables, boral fits correlated column GLMs with latent variables to account for any residual correlation between the columns of the response matrix.
